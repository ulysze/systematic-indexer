The Abstraction of QUERY is really important: WHAT IS THE TYPE OF QUERY YOU WANT FROM THE DATASET -> WHAT IS THE DATA AND ALSO WHY! -> Allows us to define strategix Indexation given The Purpose of your query! 

High-Performance Systematic Indexer. Indexing is the process of creating an Index that will speed up the retrieval of information in general from a dataset without having to scan the entire dataset for every query/usage of some data in this dataset. Indexing is then dependent of the purpose/interest of finding data from a dataset.
